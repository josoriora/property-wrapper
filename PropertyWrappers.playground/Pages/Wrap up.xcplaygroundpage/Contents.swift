 Conclusions:
 - Property Wrappers are a new way to provide functionality similar to Lazy and NSCopying but with custom rules.
 - It serves as an abstraction for setter/getter logic that is repeated across different objects.
 - For minimum implementation you at least need to add the wrappedValue var.
 - Property Wrappers can have parameters as well.
 - Projection allows us to access implementation details of the property Wrapper if needed (This is optional).
